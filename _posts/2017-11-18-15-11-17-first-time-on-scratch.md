    <td>Homework </td>
    <td>I played space invaders and the old mario, arkanoid, pacman  and donkey kong.

In space invaders the variables were the lives system and the sprites were the block you're controlling ,all of the invaders you are trying to hit including the red one and the bullets.

In the old super mario the sprites the blocks that break and the one that things come out of , the mushroom you eat ,the flower ,the enemy's and the flag at the end ; the variables are the time ,the lives and the points.

In donkey kong the sprites were donkey kong ,mario ,the platforms , the red hammer and the barrels;the variables are one up high score and the bonus.

In arkanoid the sprites were the things that fall from the blocks ,the blocks , the board you control and the ball you try to keep hitting, the one up , high score, the numbers that come off the blocks and your score 

In pacman the sprites are the aliens and pacman ; the variables are the score, lives and when you eat the aliens the number.</td>
