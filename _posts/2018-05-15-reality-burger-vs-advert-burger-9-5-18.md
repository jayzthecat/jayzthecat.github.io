    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To know how and why adverts have burgers that look better than they actually are.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes as I now know that they bring all of the things in the burger to the front and photoshop it to make it look better and they do it to attract more customers.</td>
